            What's a Scripting language?
                a snippet of code that auotmates some functionality.  It is NOT a complete applicaiton or program
                ..it's just a snippet of code.

            So then what is JavaScript?

                JavaScript is a programming/scripting language originally designed to provide functionality
                to web pages; effectively making those webpages dynamic. It allows website clients
                to run code from THEIR machines instead of always returning to a server for new
                information/calculations

                JavaScript is a scripting language.  Traditional languages like C++ are compiled BEFORE
                they're run into executable binary form.  The compiler is our best friend because it checks for errors
                before the process is complete.

                Scripting languages, by contrast are executed line by line by an INTERPRETER.

                JS is an interpreted scripting/programming language which allows more dynamic functionality to web pages.
                JS is interpreted by the Browser...Google Chrome's interpreter is v8 engine.
                FireFox's is SpiderMonkey.

                Later, JS got so popular, that someone ripped out the v8 engine (Chrome's interpreter) and wrapped
                it in a C++ shell.  Thus Node.js was born around 2009. 

                Features of JS:
                    - It's object oriented
                    - Supports Fucntional Programming
                    - Loosely typed 
                        (a variable can hold ANY data type)
                    - it's dynamic (you can easily control JS during runtime)
                        > you can modify the structure of objects while the program is running MORE than in 
                        non-dynamic languages.
                    - originally JS was built for DOM manipulation.
                        > The DOM is a virtual representaiton of the HTML page
                    - Generally JS is either interpreted by 1 of 2 things: browser, or node.js
