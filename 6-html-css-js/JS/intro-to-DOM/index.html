    <!-- Note that there are event properties like "onclick" which we'll be modifying -->

    <!-- DOM Node are just JS objects in the end - i.e reference values.  The following
    methods are Query Selectors which return the object references (addresses) 

    A Node is just an object that makes up the DOM. ELEMENTS are one type of node that possess properties and
    methods so that we can interact with them via JavaScript.

        getElementById()
        getElementsByClassName()

        -- These return collections of elements (array-like objects): NodeList --
        querySelector() -- parameter: CSS selector such as element, class name, id etc...
        getElementsByTagName()
